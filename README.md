A Single Player Game Based on the Popular [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack)/21 Card Game.

The player starts with a set score, at the beginning of a round the player is given two random cards from a standard 52 card deck. These two cards will be added together and the result added to the rounds score. 
The player then has the option to either draw another card to try and get a round score closer to 21 or to end the round and keep their current round score.
If they draw another card and bust their hand (i.e. get a score over 21) they have 21 subtracted from their total score. If they do not wish to draw another card, the difference between their total and 21 is subtracted from their total score.
The aim is to have the highest score at the end of the game consisting of several rounds.

*  Aces are worth 1
*  Face cards are worth 10
