# BlackJackVariation

A Single Player Game Based on the Popular Blackjack/21 Card Game.

The player starts with a set score (100) and if they bust their hand (i.e. get a score over 21) they have 21 subtracted from this. If they do not wish to draw another card, the difference between their total and 21 is subtracted from their total score. The aim is to have the highest score at the end of the game consisting of several rounds.
